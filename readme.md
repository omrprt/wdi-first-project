### Project Brief

Your app must:

Your app must:

* Render a game in the browser
* Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
* Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
* Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
* Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
* Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

### [](https://github.com/omrprt/wdi-first-project#approach-taken)Approach Taken

1. I started with a very short brain storming session of games and things I like.
2. Worked on the wireframe.
3. Worked on the CSS.
4. Worked on the JavaScript.
5. Had UX feedback.
6. Worked on making it responsive.
7. looped again and again.

- Atom
- GIMP

### [](https://github.com/omrprt/wdi-first-project#challenges-faced)Challenges Faced

### [](https://github.com/omrprt/wdi-first-project#where-next)Where next?

How can the game be extended and improved:

- making the layout more responsive:
 * Currently the pictures do not line up nicely when the screen is smaller.


- restart to the play area:
  * Currently it restarts by reloading the page and the user has to see the rules again.


- add audio:
    * attempted to add audio but could not implement - This has been resolved.


- Improving the code:
  * I am certain that there are areas of my code to be more efficient and dryer.
  * the code could be possibly refactored further.
