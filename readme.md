### [](https://github.com/omrprt/wdi-first-project#challenges-faced)Challenges Faced

-Drying up the code
-Randomizing the object array and choosing only twelve items from the array.
-Styling with flexbox and completely understanding how it was working.

### [](https://github.com/omrprt/wdi-first-project#where-next)Where next?

How can the game be extended and improved:

- adding difficulty levels:
  *Right now it only has one setting

- making the layout more responsive:
  *Currently the pictures do not line up nicely when the screen is smaller.

- restart to the play area:
  *Currently it restarts by reloading the page and the user has to see the rules again.

- Improving the code:
  *I am certain that there are areas of my code to be more efficient and dryer.
  *the code could be possibly refactored further.
